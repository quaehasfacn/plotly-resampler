# How to Make Hearts of Iron III Large Address Aware
 
Hearts of Iron III (Hoi3) is a grand strategy game set in World War II, developed by Paradox Interactive. It is a complex and detailed simulation of the war, with hundreds of countries, thousands of provinces, and millions of units. However, it is also notorious for its instability and frequent crashes, especially on modern systems with high resolutions and large amounts of RAM.

One of the reasons for this is that Hoi3 is a 32-bit application that can only access up to 2 GB of memory by default. This means that it can easily run out of memory when loading large save files, running many mods, or playing for a long time. This can cause the game to freeze, stutter, or crash to desktop without warning.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to make Hoi3 more stable and less prone to crashes by making it large address aware (LAA). This is a process that allows a 32-bit application to access up to 4 GB of memory on 64-bit operating systems and all memory that isn't used by the operating system and other applications on 32-bit operating systems. This can significantly improve the performance and stability of Hoi3, especially on higher resolutions and with more mods.
 
However, making Hoi3 LAA is not as simple as changing a setting in the game options or the launcher. It requires modifying the game executable file (hoi\_tfh.exe) with a third-party tool. This can be done manually or automatically, depending on your preference and skill level. Here are the steps to make Hoi3 LAA:
 
## Manual Method
 
1. Download the [Large Address Aware](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/large-address-aware.112556/) tool from TechPowerUp. It is a small application that can patch any 32-bit executable file to make it LAA.
2. Unzip the downloaded file and run the laa.exe file as administrator.
3. Browse to your Hoi3 directory (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hearts of Iron 3) and select the hoi\_tfh.exe file. This is the executable file for the latest expansion of Hoi3, Their Finest Hour. If you don't have this expansion, you can select the hoi3.exe file instead.
4. Click on Save to make a backup copy of the original executable file.
5. Click on Enable and wait for the patching process to finish.
6. Close the LAA tool and run Hoi3 normally from Steam or directly from the executable file.

## Automatic Method

1. Download the [modified EXE](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/hoi-3-on-win10.893099/) file from Paradox Plaza. It is a pre-patched version of the hoi\_tfh.exe file that is already LAA.
2. Unzip the downloaded file and copy it to your Hoi3 directory (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hearts of Iron 3), replacing the original hoi\_tfh.exe file. If you don't have Their Finest Hour expansion, you can rename it to hoi3.exe instead.
3. Run Hoi3 normally from Steam or directly from the executable file.

Note: Both methods require that you have a registered account on Paradox Plaza and own a legal copy of Hoi3 on Steam. You may also need to disable Steam's overlay or API if they cause any issues with the patched executable file. You can also revert back to the original executable file by using the backup copy created by the LAA tool or by verifying the integrity of game files on Steam.
 
Making Hoi3 LAA can greatly enhance your gaming experience by reducing crashes and improving performance. However, it is not a guarantee that you will never encounter any problems with Hoi3, as there may be other factors that affect its stability, such as mods, drivers, hardware, etc. Therefore, it is always advisable to save your game frequently and
