- **Resizable dialog boxes**: You can now resize several dialog boxes, such as Layer Properties Manager, Insert Table, and Enhanced Attribute Editor, to see more information and access more options.
- **Improved 3DORBIT**: The performance and reliability of the 3DORBIT command have been improved, especially for large 3D models. You can also use the Shift key to constrain the orbit to horizontal or vertical motion.
- **Print Studio integration**: You can easily send your 3D models from AutoCAD to Autodesk Print Studio, a tool that helps you prepare and optimize your models for 3D printing.
- **Faster object snapping**: The performance of object snapping has been improved by skipping geometric center, which is rarely used. You can also turn off geometric center snapping by setting the SNAPGEOMID system variable to 0.
- **Consistent dimensioning**: The DIMLAYER system variable is now used by all dimensioning commands, such as DIMLINEAR, DIMALIGNED, and DIMANGULAR. This ensures that all dimensions are created on the same layer.
- **New unit setting**: A new unit setting, US Survey Feet, has been added to the list of insertion scales in the Units dialog box. This is useful for working with maps and geospatial data that use this unit.

1. Start a new drawing or open an existing one.
2. Use the drawing tools, such as lines, circles, arcs, polylines, and hatches, to create the geometry of your drawing.
3. Use the modify tools, such as move, copy, rotate, scale, and trim, to edit the geometry of your drawing.
4. Use the annotation tools, such as text, dimensions, leaders, and tables, to add information and specifications to your drawing.
5. Use the layer tools, such as layer properties manager, layer states manager, and layer filters, to organize and control the visibility of your drawing objects.
6. Use the layout tools, such as layout tabs, viewports, page setup manager, and plot manager, to set up and print your drawing on paper or PDF.
7. Use the 3D tools, such as extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, and solid editing tools, to create and modify 3D models from your 2D drawings.
8. Use the rendering tools, such as materials browser, lights manager, render presets manager, and render window, to apply materials, lights, and effects to your 3D models and generate realistic images.
