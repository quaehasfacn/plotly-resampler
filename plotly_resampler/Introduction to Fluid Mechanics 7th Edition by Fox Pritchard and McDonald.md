Fluid mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of fluids (liquids and gases) at rest and in motion. It is a fundamental subject for many engineering disciplines, such as mechanical, civil, aerospace, chemical and biomedical engineering. Fluid mechanics has many applications in engineering design, analysis and optimization, such as fluid flow in pipes, pumps, turbines, airplanes, cars, blood vessels and more.

Introduction to Fluid Mechanics, 7th Edition by Fox, Pritchard and McDonald is one of the bestselling books in the field. It provides a balanced and comprehensive approach to mastering the critical concepts of fluid mechanics. The book starts with basic equations, then clearly states assumptions, and finally relates results to expected physical behavior. The book also incorporates a proven problem-solving methodology that helps readers develop an orderly plan to find the right solution. The book uses Excel to simplify many of the steps involved in analysis.
 
The book covers topics such as fluid statics, basic equations in integral form for a control volume, introduction to differential analysis of fluid motion, incompressible inviscid flow, dimensional analysis and similitude, internal incompressible viscous flow, external incompressible viscous flow and fluid machinery. The book also includes web PDFs for some chapters that provide additional material on topics such as potential flow theory, boundary layer theory and compressible flow.
 
The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students of engineering who want to learn the fundamentals of fluid mechanics. It is also a useful reference for practicing engineers who need to refresh their knowledge or solve practical problems. The book is accompanied by a companion website that offers resources such as answers to selected problems, errata, guide to Flowlab (a computational fluid dynamics software), image gallery, art powerpoints, solutions manual, lecture slides and Excel templates.

Here are some more paragraphs for the article:
 
One of the features of the book is the use of Flowlab, a computational fluid dynamics software that allows readers to simulate fluid flow problems and visualize the results. Flowlab is based on the finite volume method and can handle both laminar and turbulent flows. Flowlab can be used to model problems such as flow over a flat plate, flow around a cylinder, flow through a nozzle, flow in a pipe and more. Flowlab can also be used to compare experimental data with theoretical predictions and to explore the effects of changing parameters on the flow behavior. Flowlab is easy to use and requires no programming skills. Readers can request Flowlab from the companion website and install it on their computers.
 
Another feature of the book is the inclusion of numerous examples and problems that illustrate the application of fluid mechanics concepts to real-world situations. The examples are solved in detail and show the steps involved in applying the problem-solving methodology. The problems are classified into three levels of difficulty: basic, intermediate and advanced. The problems cover a wide range of topics and scenarios, such as water supply systems, wind tunnels, drag reduction devices, blood flow in arteries, jet engines, rockets and more. The problems also include design-oriented problems that require readers to apply their creativity and engineering judgment. The book provides answers to selected problems at the end of each chapter and solutions to all problems in the solutions manual.
